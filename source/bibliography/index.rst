Annotated Bibliography
======================

An overview of the big picture of React from [#f1]_ will be a great place to start
when looking at the React library for JavaScript.

The Research paper from Aggarwal [#f2]_ gives an in depth view of why ReactJS was
created, what its advantages are, and how it is used for modern web-development projects.

Another great source for what kinds of API's and libraries are used with ReactJS
is articulated in the React apps conference video. [#f3]_

In this website article by Pandit, [#f4]_ he discusses why react is so popular
and what makes it better than some of the other frameworks and libraries out there.
He also gives some information on how to set up react projects, and some of the
tools within react.

For a relevant book [#f5]_ I found one that goes into how to build projects with react
but it also goes into why it is more efficient then vanilla javascript. It also
discusses how to display data changes on large-scale, data-driven websites without
having to reload pages which is a key functionality of javascript and React.
